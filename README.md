# Hi

Our progress has been rather circuitous, but in the end we settled on a few things. 

One dataset we're using is [this CDC set](ftp://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/Datasets/DATA2010/State_data_tables/) (documentation available [here](http://wonder.cdc.gov/DATA2010/FTPSELEC.HTM)). 

## tl;dr

In brief, we are working on producing: 
    * an R package to tidy the excel data into an easy-to-use format
    * lead exposure and crime data, from the CDC data inventory and other sources
    * a Shiny app to easily visualize 


## Data Description

There, there is data available for all fifty states. However, the formatting is 
difficult to use. Since there is such data for numerous health conditions, for 
all fifty states, there is a need to be able to render it in usable form.
